It's my Mobile Apps homework.
A proof of concept for Ionic modals, popovers, React routes and hooks, and, also, Axios library alongside Koa routing and middlewares.

I've implemented my own synchronization algorithm that compares the data version and, in case of identical versions, declares a conflict the end-user has to manually solve.

TODO:
- conflict solution page 
- fix ability of long pressing even when scrolling
